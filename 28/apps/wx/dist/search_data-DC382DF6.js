The ID is represented by the ?wxArtID type and\ncan have one of these predefined values (you can see bitmaps represented by these\nconstants in the page_samples_artprov):\n\nAdditionally, any string recognized by custom art providers registered using `wxArtProvider::Push`\n(not implemented in wx) may be used.\n\nNote: When running under GTK+ 2, GTK+ stock item IDs (e.g. `\"gtk-cdrom\"`) may be used as\nwell: For a list of the GTK+ stock items please refer to the [GTK+ documentation page](http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/gtk-Stock-Items.html).\nIt is also possible to load icons from the current icon theme by specifying their name\n(without extension and directory components). Icon themes recognized by GTK+ follow the\nfreedesktop.org [Icon Themes specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec).\nNote that themes are not guaranteed to contain all icons, so `m:wxArtProvider` may return\n?wxNullBitmap or ?wxNullIcon. The default theme is typically installed in `/usr/share/icons/hicolor`.\n\nClients\n\nThe `client` is the entity that calls `m:wxArtProvider`'s `getBitmap/2` or `getIcon/2` function. It is\nrepresented by wxClientID type and can have one of these values:\n\n* `wxART_TOOLBAR`\n\n* `wxART_MENU`\n\n* `wxART_BUTTON`\n\n* `wxART_FRAME_ICON`\n\n* `wxART_CMN_DIALOG`\n\n* `wxART_HELP_BROWSER`\n\n* `wxART_MESSAGE_BOX`\n\n* `wxART_OTHER` (used for all requests that don't fit into any of the categories above)\n\nClient ID serve as a hint to `m:wxArtProvider` that is supposed to help it to choose the\nbest looking bitmap. For example it is often desirable to use slightly different icons in\nmenus and toolbars even though they represent the same action (e.g. wxART_FILE_OPEN).\nRemember that this is really only a hint for `m:wxArtProvider` - it is common that `getBitmap/2`\nreturns identical bitmap for different client values!\n\nSee:\n* [Examples](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/page_samples.html#page_samples_artprov)\n\n* `m:wxArtProvider`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxArtProvider](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_art_provider.html)","title":"wxArtProvider","ref":"wxArtProvider.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxArtProvider.getBitmap/1","ref":"wxArtProvider.html#getBitmap/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Query registered providers for bitmap with given ID.\n\nReturn: The bitmap if one of registered providers recognizes the ID or wxNullBitmap\notherwise.","title":"wxArtProvider.getBitmap/2","ref":"wxArtProvider.html#getBitmap/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxArtProvider.getIcon/1","ref":"wxArtProvider.html#getIcon/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Same as `getBitmap/2`, but return a `m:wxIcon` object (or ?wxNullIcon on failure).","title":"wxArtProvider.getIcon/2","ref":"wxArtProvider.html#getIcon/2"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxArtProvider.wxArtProvider/0","ref":"wxArtProvider.html#t:wxArtProvider/0"},{"type":"module","doc":"`m:wxAuiDockArt` is part of the wxAUI class framework.\n\nSee also overview_aui.\n\n`m:wxAuiDockArt` is the art provider: provides all drawing functionality to the wxAui\ndock manager.

It\nuses a replaceable dock art class to do all drawing, so all drawing is localized in one\narea, and may be customized depending on an application's specific needs.\n\n`m:wxAuiManager` works as follows: the programmer adds panes to the class, or makes\nchanges to existing pane properties (dock position, floating state, show state, etc.). To\napply these changes, `m:wxAuiManager`'s `update/1` function is called. This batch processing can be\nused to avoid flicker, by modifying more than one pane at a time, and then \"committing\"\nall of the changes at once by calling `update/1`.\n\nPanes can be added quite easily:\n\nLater on, the positions can be modified easily. The following will float an existing pane\nin a tool window:\n\nLayers, Rows and Directions, Positions\n\nInside wxAUI, the docking layout is figured out by checking several pane parameters. Four\nof these are important for determining where a pane will end up:\n\n* Direction: Each docked pane has a direction, Top, Bottom, Left, Right, or Center. This is\nfairly self-explanatory. The pane will be placed in the location specified by this\nvariable.\n\n* Position: More than one pane can be placed inside of a dock. Imagine two panes being\ndocked on the left side of a window. One pane can be placed over another. In\nproportionally managed docks, the pane position indicates its sequential position,\nstarting with zero. So, in our scenario with two panes docked on the left side, the top\npane in the dock would have position 0, and the second one would occupy position 1.\n\n* Row: A row can allow for two docks to be placed next to each other. One of the most\ncommon places for this to happen is in the toolbar. Multiple toolbar rows are allowed, the\nfirst row being row 0, and the second row 1. Rows can also be used on vertically docked\npanes.\n\n* Layer: A layer is akin to an onion. Layer 0 is the very center of the managed pane. Thus,\nif a pane is in layer 0, it will be closest to the center window (also sometimes known as\nthe \"content window\"). Increasing layers \"swallow up\" all layers of a lower value. This\ncan look very similar to multiple rows, but is different because all panes in a lower\nlevel yield to panes in higher levels. The best way to understand layers is by running the\nwxAUI sample.","title":"wxAuiManager","ref":"wxAuiManager.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"This class supports the following styles:\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_ALLOW_FLOATING: Allow a pane to be undocked to take the form of a `m:wxMiniFrame`.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_ALLOW_ACTIVE_PANE: Change the color of the title bar of the pane when it is\nactivated.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_TRANSPARENT_DRAG: Make the pane transparent during its movement.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_TRANSPARENT_HINT: The possible location for docking is indicated by a\ntranslucent area.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_VENETIAN_BLINDS_HINT: The possible location for docking is indicated by\ngradually appearing partially transparent hint.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_RECTANGLE_HINT: The possible location for docking is indicated by a rectangular\noutline.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_HINT_FADE: The translucent area where the pane could be docked appears\ngradually.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_NO_VENETIAN_BLINDS_FADE: Used in complement of wxAUI_MGR_VENETIAN_BLINDS_HINT\nto show the docking hint immediately.\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_LIVE_RESIZE: When a docked pane is resized, its content is refreshed in live\n(instead of moving the border alone and refreshing the content at the end).\n\n* wxAUI_MGR_DEFAULT: Default behaviour, combines: wxAUI_MGR_ALLOW_FLOATING |\nwxAUI_MGR_TRANSPARENT_HINT | wxAUI_MGR_HINT_FADE | wxAUI_MGR_NO_VENETIAN_BLINDS_FADE.\n\nSee:\n* [Overview aui](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_aui.html#overview_aui)\n\n* `m:wxAuiNotebook`\n\n* `m:wxAuiDockArt`\n\n* `m:wxAuiPaneInfo`\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxEvtHandler`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxAuiManager](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_aui_manager.html)","title":"Styles - wxAuiManager","ref":"wxAuiManager.html#module-styles"},{"type":"module","doc":"Event types emitted from this class:\n\n* [`aui_pane_button`](`m:wxAuiManagerEvent`)\n\n* [`aui_pane_close`](`m:wxAuiManagerEvent`)\n\n* [`aui_pane_maximize`](`m:wxAuiManagerEvent`)\n\n* [`aui_pane_restore`](`m:wxAuiManagerEvent`)\n\n* [`aui_pane_activated`](`m:wxAuiManagerEvent`)\n\n* [`aui_render`](`m:wxAuiManagerEvent`)","title":"Events - wxAuiManager","ref":"wxAuiManager.html#module-events"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxAuiManager.addPane/2","ref":"wxAuiManager.html#addPane/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"`addPane/4` tells the frame manager to start managing a child window.\n\nThere are several versions of this function.

The validity of those values depends however on the platform\nwhere your program is running and from the wxWidgets configuration. If all possible\nwxWidgets settings are used:\n\n* wxMSW supports BMP and ICO files, BMP and ICO resources;\n\n* wxGTK supports any file supported by gdk-pixbuf;\n\n* wxMac supports PICT resources;\n\n* wxX11 supports XPM files, XPM data, XBM data;\n\nIn addition, `m:wxBitmap` can load and save all formats that `m:wxImage` can; see `m:wxImage`\nfor more info. Of course, you must have loaded the `m:wxImage` handlers (see\n?wxInitAllImageHandlers() and `wxImage::AddHandler` (not implemented in wx)). Note that\nall available wxBitmapHandlers for a given wxWidgets port are automatically loaded at\nstartup so you won't need to use `wxBitmap::AddHandler` (not implemented in wx).\n\nMore on the difference between `m:wxImage` and `m:wxBitmap`: `m:wxImage` is just a buffer\nof RGB bytes with an optional buffer for the alpha bytes. It is all generic, platform\nindependent and image file format independent code. It includes generic code for scaling,\nresizing, clipping, and other manipulations of the image data. OTOH, `m:wxBitmap` is\nintended to be a wrapper of whatever is the native image format that is quickest/easiest\nto draw to a DC or to be the target of the drawing operations performed on a `m:wxMemoryDC`.\nBy splitting the responsibilities between wxImage/wxBitmap like this then it's easier to\nuse generic code shared by all platforms and image types for generic operations and\nplatform specific code where performance or compatibility is needed.\n\nPredefined objects (include wx.hrl): ?wxNullBitmap\n\nSee:\n* [Overview bitmap](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_bitmap.html#overview_bitmap)\n\n* [Overview bitmap](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_bitmap.html#overview_bitmap_supportedformats)\n\n* `wxDC:blit/6`\n\n* `m:wxIcon`\n\n* `m:wxCursor`\n\n* `m:wxMemoryDC`\n\n* `m:wxImage`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxBitmap](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_bitmap.html)","title":"wxBitmap","ref":"wxBitmap.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"Creates an image from a platform-dependent bitmap.\n\nThis preserves mask information so that bitmaps and images can be converted back and\nforth without loss in that respect.","title":"wxBitmap.convertToImage/1","ref":"wxBitmap.html#convertToImage/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Creates the bitmap from an icon.","title":"wxBitmap.copyFromIcon/2","ref":"wxBitmap.html#copyFromIcon/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxBitmap.create/2","ref":"wxBitmap.html#create/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience.

If the button has both a label and a bitmap, the\nalignment styles above specify the location of the rectangle combining both the label and\nthe bitmap and the bitmap position set with `wxButton::SetBitmapPosition()` (not\nimplemented in wx) defines the relative position of the bitmap with respect to the label\n(however currently non-default alignment combinations are not implemented on all platforms).\n\nSince version 2.9.1 `m:wxButton` supports showing both text and an image (currently only\nwhen using wxMSW, wxGTK or wxOSX/Cocoa ports), see `SetBitmap()` (not implemented in wx)\nand `setBitmapLabel/2`, `setBitmapDisabled/2` &c methods.

See `m:wxGraphicsContext`, `m:wxGraphicsRenderer` and\nrelated classes. There is also a `m:wxGCDC` linking the APIs by offering the `m:wxDC` API\non top of a `m:wxGraphicsContext`.\n\n`m:wxDC` is an abstract base class and cannot be created directly. Use `m:wxPaintDC`, `m:wxClientDC`, `m:wxWindowDC`, `m:wxScreenDC`, `m:wxMemoryDC`\nor `wxPrinterDC` (not implemented in wx). Notice that device contexts which are\nassociated with windows (i.e. `m:wxClientDC`, `m:wxWindowDC` and `m:wxPaintDC`) use the\nwindow font and colours by default (starting with wxWidgets 2.9.0) but the other device\ncontext classes use system-default values so you always must set the appropriate fonts and\ncolours before using them.\n\nIn addition to the versions of the methods documented below, there are also versions\nwhich accept single {X,Y} parameter instead of the two wxCoord ones or {X,Y} and\n{Width,Height} instead of the four wxCoord parameters.\n\nBeginning with wxWidgets 2.9.0 the entire `m:wxDC` code has been reorganized. All\nplatform dependent code (actually all drawing code) has been moved into backend classes\nwhich derive from a common wxDCImpl class. The user-visible classes such as `m:wxClientDC`\nand `m:wxPaintDC` merely forward all calls to the backend implementation.\n\nDevice and logical units\n\nIn the `m:wxDC` context there is a distinction between `logical` units and `device` units.\n\n`Device` units are the units native to the particular device; e.g. for a screen, a device\nunit is a `pixel`. For a printer, the device unit is defined by the resolution of the\nprinter (usually given in `DPI:` dot-per-inch).\n\nAll `m:wxDC` functions use instead `logical` units, unless where explicitly stated.\nLogical units are arbitrary units mapped to device units using the current mapping mode\n(see `setMapMode/2`).\n\nThis mechanism allows reusing the same code which prints on e.g. a window on the screen\nto print on e.g. a paper.\n\nSupport for Transparency / Alpha Channel\n\nIn general `m:wxDC` methods don't support alpha transparency and the alpha component of `wx_color()`\nis simply ignored and you need to use `m:wxGraphicsContext` for full transparency support.\nThere are, however, a few exceptions: first, under macOS and GTK+ 3 colours with alpha\nchannel are supported in all the normal wxDC-derived classes as they use `m:wxGraphicsContext`\ninternally. Second, under all platforms `wxSVGFileDC` (not implemented in wx) also fully\nsupports alpha channel. In both of these cases the instances of `m:wxPen` or `m:wxBrush`\nthat are built from `wx_color()` use the colour's alpha values when stroking or filling.\n\nSupport for Transformation Matrix\n\nOn some platforms (currently under MSW, GTK+ 3, macOS) `m:wxDC` has support for applying\nan arbitrary affine transformation matrix to its coordinate system (since 3.1.1 this\nfeature is also supported by `m:wxGCDC` in all ports). Call `CanUseTransformMatrix()` (not\nimplemented in wx) to check if this support is available and then call `SetTransformMatrix()`\n(not implemented in wx) if it is. If the transformation matrix is not supported, `SetTransformMatrix()`\n(not implemented in wx) always simply returns `false` and doesn't do anything.\n\nThis feature is only available when `wxUSE_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX` build option is enabled.\n\nSee:\n* [Overview dc](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_dc.html#overview_dc)\n\n* `m:wxGraphicsContext`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxDC](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_d_c.html)","title":"wxDC","ref":"wxDC.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxDC.blit/5","ref":"wxDC.html#blit/5"},{"type":"function","doc":"Copy from a source DC to this DC.\n\nWith this method you can specify the destination coordinates and the size of area to copy\nwhich will be the same for both the source and target DCs.

Being 'smart' here means that the\ndata object itself should know what data formats it supports and how to render itself in\neach of its supported formats.\n\nA supported format, incidentally, is exactly the format in which the data can be\nrequested from a data object or from which the data object may be set. In the general\ncase, an object may support different formats on 'input' and 'output', i.e. it may be able\nto render itself in a given format but not be created from data on this format or vice\nversa. `m:wxDataObject` defines the `wxDataObject::Direction` (not implemented in wx)\nenumeration type which distinguishes between them.\n\nSee `wxDataFormat` (not implemented in wx) documentation for more about formats.\n\nNot surprisingly, being 'smart' comes at a price of added complexity. This is reasonable\nfor the situations when you really need to support multiple formats, but may be annoying\nif you only want to do something simple like cut and paste text.\n\nTo provide a solution for both cases, wxWidgets has two predefined classes which derive\nfrom `m:wxDataObject`: `wxDataObjectSimple` (not implemented in wx) and `wxDataObjectComposite`\n(not implemented in wx). `wxDataObjectSimple` (not implemented in wx) is the simplest `m:wxDataObject`\npossible and only holds data in a single format (such as HTML or text) and `wxDataObjectComposite`\n(not implemented in wx) is the simplest way to implement a `m:wxDataObject` that does\nsupport multiple formats because it achieves this by simply holding several `wxDataObjectSimple`\n(not implemented in wx) objects.\n\nSo, you have several solutions when you need a `m:wxDataObject` class (and you need one\nas soon as you want to transfer data via the clipboard or drag and drop):\n\nPlease note that the easiest way to use drag and drop and the clipboard with multiple\nformats is by using `wxDataObjectComposite` (not implemented in wx), but it is not the\nmost efficient one as each `wxDataObjectSimple` (not implemented in wx) would contain the\nwhole data in its respective formats. Now imagine that you want to paste 200 pages of text\nin your proprietary format, as well as Word, RTF, HTML, Unicode and plain text to the\nclipboard and even today's computers are in trouble. For this case, you will have to\nderive from `m:wxDataObject` directly and make it enumerate its formats and provide the\ndata in the requested format on demand.\n\nNote that neither the GTK+ data transfer mechanisms for clipboard and drag and drop, nor\nOLE data transfer, `copies` any data until another application actually requests the data.\nThis is in contrast to the 'feel' offered to the user of a program who would normally\nthink that the data resides in the clipboard after having pressed 'Copy' - in reality it\nis only declared to be `available`.\n\nYou may also derive your own data object classes from `wxCustomDataObject` (not\nimplemented in wx) for user-defined types. The format of user-defined data is given as a\nmime-type string literal, such as \"application/word\" or \"image/png\". These strings are\nused as they are under Unix (so far only GTK+) to identify a format and are translated\ninto their Windows equivalent under Win32 (using the OLE IDataObject for data exchange to\nand from the clipboard and for drag and drop). Note that the format string translation\nunder Windows is not yet finished.\n\nEach class derived directly from `m:wxDataObject` must override and implement all of its\nfunctions which are pure virtual in the base class. The data objects which only render\ntheir data or only set it (i.e. work in only one direction), should return 0 from `GetFormatCount()`\n(not implemented in wx).\n\nSee:\n* [Overview dnd](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_dnd.html#overview_dnd)\n\n* [Examples](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/page_samples.html#page_samples_dnd)\n\n* `m:wxFileDataObject`\n\n* `m:wxTextDataObject`\n\n* `m:wxBitmapDataObject`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxDataObject](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_data_object.html)","title":"wxDataObject","ref":"wxDataObject.html"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxDataObject.wxDataObject/0","ref":"wxDataObject.html#t:wxDataObject/0"},{"type":"module","doc":"This event class holds information about a date change and is used together with `m:wxDatePickerCtrl`.\n\nIt also serves as a base class for `m:wxCalendarEvent`.\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxCommandEvent`\n\n* `m:wxEvent`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxDateEvent](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_date_event.html)","title":"wxDateEvent","ref":"wxDateEvent.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns the date.","title":"wxDateEvent.getDate/1","ref":"wxDateEvent.html#getDate/1"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxDateEvent.wxDate/0","ref":"wxDateEvent.html#t:wxDate/0"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxDateEvent.wxDateEvent/0","ref":"wxDateEvent.html#t:wxDateEvent/0"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxDateEvent.wxDateEventType/0","ref":"wxDateEvent.html#t:wxDateEventType/0"},{"type":"module","doc":"This control allows the user to select a date.\n\nUnlike `m:wxCalendarCtrl`, which is a relatively big control, `m:wxDatePickerCtrl` is\nimplemented as a small window showing the currently selected date.

Starting\nwith wxWidgets 2.7 it is also possible to use a button with a different identifier\ninstead, see `setAffirmativeId/2` and `SetEscapeId()` (not implemented in wx).\n\nAlso notice that the `createButtonSizer/2` should be used to create the buttons appropriate for the current\nplatform and positioned correctly (including their order which is platform-dependent).\n\nModal and Modeless\n\nThere are two kinds of dialog, modal and modeless. A modal dialog blocks program flow and\nuser input on other windows until it is dismissed, whereas a modeless dialog behaves more\nlike a frame in that program flow continues, and input in other windows is still possible.\nTo show a modal dialog you should use the `showModal/1` method while to show a dialog modelessly you\nsimply use `show/2`, just as with frames.\n\nNote that the modal dialog is one of the very few examples of wxWindow-derived objects\nwhich may be created on the stack and not on the heap. In other words, while most windows\nwould be created like this:\n\nYou can achieve the same result with dialogs by using simpler code:\n\nAn application can define a `m:wxCloseEvent` handler for the dialog to respond to system\nclose events.","title":"wxDialog","ref":"wxDialog.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"This class supports the following styles:\n\n* wxCAPTION: Puts a caption on the dialog box.\n\n* wxDEFAULT_DIALOG_STYLE: Equivalent to a combination of wxCAPTION, wxCLOSE_BOX and\nwxSYSTEM_MENU (the last one is not used under Unix).\n\n* wxRESIZE_BORDER: Display a resizable frame around the window.\n\n* wxSYSTEM_MENU: Display a system menu.\n\n* wxCLOSE_BOX: Displays a close box on the frame.\n\n* wxMAXIMIZE_BOX: Displays a maximize box on the dialog.\n\n* wxMINIMIZE_BOX: Displays a minimize box on the dialog.\n\n* wxTHICK_FRAME: Display a thick frame around the window.\n\n* wxSTAY_ON_TOP: The dialog stays on top of all other windows.\n\n* wxNO_3D: This style is obsolete and doesn't do anything any more, don't use it in any new\ncode.\n\n* wxDIALOG_NO_PARENT: By default, a dialog created with a NULL parent window will be given\nthe `application's top level window` (not implemented in wx) as parent.

The children of hidden windows do not receive idle events however as they can't\nchange their state in any way noticeable by the user. Finally, the global `wxApp` (not\nimplemented in wx) object also receives these events, as usual, so it can be used for any\nglobal idle time processing.\n\nIf sending idle events to all windows is causing a significant overhead in your\napplication, you can call `setMode/1` with the value wxIDLE_PROCESS_SPECIFIED, and set the\nwxWS_EX_PROCESS_IDLE extra window style for every window which should receive idle events,\nall the other ones will not receive them in this case.\n\nDelayed Action Mechanism\n\n`m:wxIdleEvent` can be used to perform some action \"at slightly later time\". This can be\nnecessary in several circumstances when, for whatever reason, something can't be done in\nthe current event handler. For example, if a mouse event handler is called with the mouse\nbutton pressed, the mouse can be currently captured and some operations with it - notably\ncapturing it again - might be impossible or lead to undesirable results. If you still want\nto capture it, you can do it from `wxEVT_IDLE` handler when it is called the next time\ninstead of doing it immediately.\n\nThis can be achieved in two different ways: when using static event tables, you will need\na flag indicating to the (always connected) idle event handler whether the desired action\nshould be performed. The originally called handler would then set it to indicate that it\nshould indeed be done and the idle handler itself would reset it to prevent it from doing\nthe same action again.\n\nUsing dynamically connected event handlers things are even simpler as the original event\nhandler can simply `wxEvtHandler::Connect()` (not implemented in wx) or `wxEvtHandler::Bind()`\n(not implemented in wx) the idle event handler which would only be executed then and\ncould `wxEvtHandler::Disconnect()` (not implemented in wx) or `wxEvtHandler::Unbind()`\n(not implemented in wx) itself.\n\nSee:\n* [Overview events](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_events.html#overview_events)\n\n* `m:wxUpdateUIEvent`\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxEvent`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxIdleEvent](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_idle_event.html)","title":"wxIdleEvent","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"Use `wxEvtHandler:connect/3` with `wxIdleEventType` to subscribe to events of this type.","title":"Events - wxIdleEvent","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#module-events"},{"type":"function","doc":"Static function returning a value specifying how wxWidgets will send idle events: to all\nwindows, or only to those which specify that they will process the events.\n\nSee: `setMode/1`","title":"wxIdleEvent.getMode/0","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#getMode/0"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns true if the OnIdle function processing this event requested more processing time.\n\nSee: `requestMore/2`","title":"wxIdleEvent.moreRequested/1","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#moreRequested/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxIdleEvent.requestMore/1","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#requestMore/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Tells wxWidgets that more processing is required.\n\nThis function can be called by an OnIdle handler for a window or window event handler to\nindicate that wxApp::OnIdle should forward the OnIdle event once more to the application windows.\n\nIf no window calls this function during OnIdle, then the application will remain in a\npassive event loop (not calling OnIdle) until a new event is posted to the application by\nthe windowing system.\n\nSee: `moreRequested/1`","title":"wxIdleEvent.requestMore/2","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#requestMore/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Static function for specifying how wxWidgets will send idle events: to all windows, or\nonly to those which specify that they will process the events.","title":"wxIdleEvent.setMode/1","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#setMode/1"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxIdleEvent.wxIdle/0","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#t:wxIdle/0"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxIdleEvent.wxIdleEvent/0","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#t:wxIdleEvent/0"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxIdleEvent.wxIdleEventType/0","ref":"wxIdleEvent.html#t:wxIdleEventType/0"},{"type":"module","doc":"This class encapsulates a platform-independent image.\n\nAn image can be created from data, or using `wxBitmap:convertToImage/1`. An image can be loaded from a file in a\nvariety of formats, and is extensible to new formats via image format handlers. Functions\nare available to set and get image bits, so it can be used for basic image manipulation.\n\nA `m:wxImage` cannot (currently) be drawn directly to a `m:wxDC`. Instead, a\nplatform-specific `m:wxBitmap` object must be created from it using the\nwxBitmap::wxBitmap(wxImage,int depth) constructor. This bitmap can then be drawn in a\ndevice context, using `wxDC:drawBitmap/4`.\n\nMore on the difference between `m:wxImage` and `m:wxBitmap`: `m:wxImage` is just a buffer\nof RGB bytes with an optional buffer for the alpha bytes. It is all generic, platform\nindependent and image file format independent code. It includes generic code for scaling,\nresizing, clipping, and other manipulations of the image data. OTOH, `m:wxBitmap` is\nintended to be a wrapper of whatever is the native image format that is quickest/easiest\nto draw to a DC or to be the target of the drawing operations performed on a `m:wxMemoryDC`.\nBy splitting the responsibilities between wxImage/wxBitmap like this then it's easier to\nuse generic code shared by all platforms and image types for generic operations and\nplatform specific code where performance or compatibility is needed.\n\nOne colour value of the image may be used as a mask colour which will lead to the\nautomatic creation of a `m:wxMask` object associated to the bitmap object.\n\nAlpha channel support\n\nStarting from wxWidgets 2.5.0 `m:wxImage` supports alpha channel data, that is in\naddition to a byte for the red, green and blue colour components for each pixel it also\nstores a byte representing the pixel opacity.\n\nAn alpha value of 0 corresponds to a transparent pixel (null opacity) while a value of\n255 means that the pixel is 100% opaque. The constants ?wxIMAGE\\_ALPHA\\_TRANSPARENT and\n?wxIMAGE\\_ALPHA\\_OPAQUE can be used to indicate those values in a more readable form.\n\nWhile all images have RGB data, not all images have an alpha channel. Before using `getAlpha/3` you\nshould check if this image contains an alpha channel with `hasAlpha/1`. Currently the BMP, PNG, TGA,\nand TIFF format handlers have full alpha channel support for loading so if you want to use\nalpha you have to use one of these formats. If you initialize the image alpha channel\nyourself using `setAlpha/4`, you should save it in either PNG, TGA, or TIFF format to avoid losing it\nas these are the only handlers that currently support saving with alpha.\n\nAvailable image handlers\n\nThe following image handlers are available. wxBMPHandler is always installed by default.\nTo use other image formats, install the appropriate handler with `wxImage::AddHandler`\n(not implemented in wx) or call ?wxInitAllImageHandlers().\n\n* wxBMPHandler: For loading (including alpha support) and saving, always installed.\n\n* `wxPNGHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving. Includes alpha support.\n\n* `wxJPEGHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving.\n\n* `wxGIFHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving (see below).\n\n* `wxPCXHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving (see below).\n\n* `wxPNMHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving (see below).\n\n* `wxTIFFHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving. Includes alpha support.\n\n* `wxTGAHandler` (not implemented in wx): For loading and saving.

This is typically used for loading thumbnails and the\nadvantage of using these options compared to calling `rescale/4` after loading is that some handlers\n(only JPEG one right now) support rescaling the image during loading which is vastly more\nefficient than loading the entire huge image and rescaling it later (if these options are\nnot supported by the handler, this is still what happens however). These options must be\nset before calling `loadFile/4` to have any effect.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_ORIGINAL_WIDTH` and `wxIMAGE_OPTION_ORIGINAL_HEIGHT:` These options will\nreturn the original size of the image if either `wxIMAGE_OPTION_MAX_WIDTH` or `wxIMAGE_OPTION_MAX_HEIGHT`\nis specified.\n\nSince: 2.9.3\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_QUALITY:` JPEG quality used when saving. This is an integer in 0..100\nrange with 0 meaning very poor and 100 excellent (but very badly compressed). This option\nis currently ignored for the other formats.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONUNIT:` The value of this option determines whether the\nresolution of the image is specified in centimetres or inches, see wxImageResolution enum elements.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTION`, `wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONX` and `wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONY:`\nThese options define the resolution of the image in the units corresponding to `wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONUNIT`\noptions value. The first option can be set before saving the image to set both horizontal\nand vertical resolution to the same value. The X and Y options are set by the image\nhandlers if they support the image resolution (currently BMP, JPEG and TIFF handlers do)\nand the image provides the resolution information and can be queried after loading the image.\n\nOptions specific to `wxPNGHandler` (not implemented in wx):\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_FORMAT:` Format for saving a PNG file, see wxImagePNGType for the\nsupported values.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_BITDEPTH:` Bit depth for every channel (R/G/B/A).\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_FILTER:` Filter for saving a PNG file, see libpng ([http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-1.2.5-manual.html](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-1.2.5-manual.html))\nfor possible values (e.g. PNG_FILTER_NONE, PNG_FILTER_SUB, PNG_FILTER_UP, etc).\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_LEVEL:` Compression level (0..9) for saving a PNG file.\nAn high value creates smaller-but-slower PNG file. Note that unlike other formats (e.g.\nJPEG) the PNG format is always lossless and thus this compression level doesn't tradeoff\nthe image quality.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_MEM_LEVEL:` Compression memory usage level (1..9) for\nsaving a PNG file. An high value means the saving process consumes more memory, but may\ncreate smaller PNG file.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_STRATEGY:` Possible values are 0 for default strategy, 1\nfor filter, and 2 for Huffman-only. You can use OptiPNG ([http://optipng.sourceforge.net/](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/))\nto get a suitable value for your application.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_BUFFER_SIZE:` Internal buffer size (in bytes) for saving\na PNG file. Ideally this should be as big as the resulting PNG file. Use this option if\nyour application produces images with small size variation.\n\nOptions specific to `wxTIFFHandler` (not implemented in wx):\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_BITSPERSAMPLE:` Number of bits per sample (channel). Currently\nvalues of 1 and 8 are supported. A value of 1 results in a black and white image. A value\nof 8 (the default) can mean greyscale or RGB, depending on the value of `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_SAMPLESPERPIXEL`.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_SAMPLESPERPIXEL:` Number of samples (channels) per pixel. Currently\nvalues of 1 and 3 are supported. A value of 1 results in either a greyscale (by default)\nor black and white image, depending on the value of `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_BITSPERSAMPLE`. A\nvalue of 3 (the default) will result in an RGB image.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_COMPRESSION:` Compression type. By default it is set to 1\n(COMPRESSION_NONE). Typical other values are 5 (COMPRESSION_LZW) and 7 (COMPRESSION_JPEG).\nSee tiff.h for more options.\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_PHOTOMETRIC:` Specifies the photometric interpretation. By default\nit is set to 2 (PHOTOMETRIC_RGB) for RGB images and 0 (PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE) for\ngreyscale or black and white images. It can also be set to 1 (PHOTOMETRIC_MINISBLACK) to\ntreat the lowest value as black and highest as white. If you want a greyscale image it is\nalso sufficient to only specify `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_PHOTOMETRIC` and set it to either\nPHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE or PHOTOMETRIC_MINISBLACK. The other values are taken care of.\n\nOptions specific to `wxGIFHandler` (not implemented in wx):\n\n* `wxIMAGE_OPTION_GIF_TRANSPARENCY:` How to deal with transparent pixels. By default, the\ncolor of transparent pixels is changed to bright pink, so that if the image is\naccidentally drawn without transparency, it will be obvious. Normally, this would not be\nnoticed, as these pixels will not be rendered. But in some cases it might be useful to\nload a GIF without making any modifications to its colours. Use `wxIMAGE_OPTION_GIF_TRANSPARENCY_UNCHANGED`\nto keep the colors correct. Use `wxIMAGE_OPTION_GIF_TRANSPARENCY_HIGHLIGHT` to convert\ntransparent pixels to pink (default). This option has been added in wxWidgets 3.1.1.\n\nNote: Be careful when combining the options `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_SAMPLESPERPIXEL`, `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_BITSPERSAMPLE`,\nand `wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_PHOTOMETRIC`. While some measures are taken to prevent illegal\ncombinations and/or values, it is still easy to abuse them and come up with invalid\nresults in the form of either corrupted images or crashes.\n\nReturn: The value of the option or 0 if not found.

It can\nbe accessed using either `getKeyCode/1` function or `getUnicodeKey/1`. For the printable characters, the latter should be\nused as it works for any keys, including non-Latin-1 characters that can be entered when\nusing national keyboard layouts. `getKeyCode/1` should be used to handle special characters (such as\ncursor arrows keys or `HOME` or `INS` and so on) which correspond to ?wxKeyCode enum\nelements above the `WXK_START` constant. While `getKeyCode/1` also returns the character code for\nLatin-1 keys for compatibility, it doesn't work for Unicode characters in general and will\nreturn `WXK_NONE` for any non-Latin-1 ones. For this reason, it's recommended to always\nuse `getUnicodeKey/1` and only fall back to `getKeyCode/1` if `getUnicodeKey/1` returned `WXK_NONE` meaning that the event corresponds to\na non-printable special keys.\n\nWhile both of these functions can be used with the events of `wxEVT_KEY_DOWN`, `wxEVT_KEY_UP`\nand `wxEVT_CHAR` types, the values returned by them are different for the first two\nevents and the last one. For the latter, the key returned corresponds to the character\nthat would appear in e.g. a text zone if the user pressed the key in it. As such, its\nvalue depends on the current state of the Shift key and, for the letters, on the state of\nCaps Lock modifier. For example, if `A` key is pressed without Shift being held down, `m:wxKeyEvent`\nof type `wxEVT_CHAR` generated for this key press will return (from either `getKeyCode/1` or `getUnicodeKey/1` as their\nmeanings coincide for ASCII characters) key code of 97 corresponding the ASCII value of `a`.\nAnd if the same key is pressed but with Shift being held (or Caps Lock being active), then\nthe key could would be 65, i.e. ASCII value of capital `A`.\n\nHowever for the key down and up events the returned key code will instead be `A`\nindependently of the state of the modifier keys i.e. it depends only on physical key being\npressed and is not translated to its logical representation using the current keyboard\nstate. Such untranslated key codes are defined as follows:\n\n* For the letters they correspond to the `upper` case value of the letter.\n\n* For the other alphanumeric keys (e.g. `7` or `+`), the untranslated key code corresponds to\nthe character produced by the key when it is pressed without Shift. E.g. in standard US\nkeyboard layout the untranslated key code for the key `=/+` in the upper right corner of\nthe keyboard is 61 which is the ASCII value of `=`.\n\n* For the rest of the keys (i.e. special non-printable keys) it is the same as the normal\nkey code as no translation is used anyhow.\n\nNotice that the first rule applies to all Unicode letters, not just the usual Latin-1\nones. However for non-Latin-1 letters only `getUnicodeKey/1` can be used to retrieve the key code as `getKeyCode/1` just\nreturns `WXK_NONE` in this case.\n\nTo summarize: you should handle `wxEVT_CHAR` if you need the translated key and `wxEVT_KEY_DOWN`\nif you only need the value of the key itself, independent of the current keyboard state.\n\nNote: Not all key down events may be generated by the user. As an example, `wxEVT_KEY_DOWN`\nwith `=` key code can be generated using the standard US keyboard layout but not using\nthe German one because the `=` key corresponds to Shift-0 key combination in this layout\nand the key code for it is `0`, not `=`. Because of this you should avoid requiring your\nusers to type key events that might be impossible to enter on their keyboard.\n\nAnother difference between key and char events is that another kind of translation is\ndone for the latter ones when the Control key is pressed: char events for ASCII letters in\nthis case carry codes corresponding to the ASCII value of Ctrl-Latter, i.e. 1 for Ctrl-A,\n2 for Ctrl-B and so on until 26 for Ctrl-Z. This is convenient for terminal-like\napplications and can be completely ignored by all the other ones (if you need to handle\nCtrl-A it is probably a better idea to use the key event rather than the char one). Notice\nthat currently no translation is done for the presses of [, `\\`, ], `^` and `_` keys which\nmight be mapped to ASCII values from 27 to 31. Since version 2.9.2, the enum values `WXK_CONTROL_A`\n- `WXK_CONTROL_Z` can be used instead of the non-descriptive constant values 1-26.\n\nFinally, modifier keys only generate key events but no char events at all. The modifiers\nkeys are `WXK_SHIFT`, `WXK_CONTROL`, `WXK_ALT` and various `WXK_WINDOWS_XXX` from\n?wxKeyCode enum.\n\nModifier keys events are special in one additional aspect: usually the keyboard state\nassociated with a key press is well defined, e.g. `shiftDown/1` returns `true` only if the Shift key\nwas held pressed when the key that generated this event itself was pressed. There is an\nambiguity for the key press events for Shift key itself however. By convention, it is\nconsidered to be already pressed when it is pressed and already released when it is\nreleased. In other words, `wxEVT_KEY_DOWN` event for the Shift key itself will have `wxMOD_SHIFT`\nin `getModifiers/1` and `shiftDown/1` will return true while the `wxEVT_KEY_UP` event for Shift itself will not have `wxMOD_SHIFT`\nin its modifiers and `shiftDown/1` will return false.\n\n`Tip:` You may discover the key codes and modifiers generated by all the keys on your\nsystem interactively by running the page_samples_keyboard wxWidgets sample and pressing\nsome keys in it.\n\nNote: If a key down (`EVT_KEY_DOWN`) event is caught and the event handler does not call `event.Skip()`\nthen the corresponding char event (`EVT_CHAR`) will not happen. This is by design and\nenables the programs that handle both types of events to avoid processing the same key\ntwice. As a consequence, if you do not want to suppress the `wxEVT_CHAR` events for the\nkeys you handle, always call `event.Skip()` in your `wxEVT_KEY_DOWN` handler. Not doing\nmay also prevent accelerators defined using this key from working.\n\nNote: If a key is maintained in a pressed state, you will typically get a lot of\n(automatically generated) key down events but only one key up one at the end when the key\nis released so it is wrong to assume that there is one up event corresponding to each down one.\n\nNote: For Windows programmers: The key and char events in wxWidgets are similar to but\nslightly different from Windows `WM_KEYDOWN` and `WM_CHAR` events. In particular, Alt-x\ncombination will generate a char event in wxWidgets (unless it is used as an accelerator)\nand almost all keys, including ones without ASCII equivalents, generate char events too.\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxEvent`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxKeyEvent](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_key_event.html)","title":"wxKeyEvent","ref":"wxKeyEvent.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"Use `wxEvtHandler:connect/3` with `wxKeyEventType` to subscribe to events of this type.","title":"Events - wxKeyEvent","ref":"wxKeyEvent.html#module-events"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns true if the Alt key is pressed.\n\nNotice that `getModifiers/1` should usually be used instead of this one.","title":"wxKeyEvent.altDown/1","ref":"wxKeyEvent.html#altDown/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns true if the key used for command accelerators is pressed.\n\nSame as `controlDown/1`.

For MDI parent frames, the algorithm\nallocates the remaining space to the MDI client window (which contains the MDI child frames).\n\nFor SDI (normal) frames, a 'main' window is specified as taking up the remaining space.\n\nBecause the event system is used, this technique can be applied to any windows, which are\nnot necessarily 'aware' of the layout classes (no virtual functions in `m:wxWindow` refer\nto `m:wxLayoutAlgorithm` or its events). However, you may wish to use `m:wxSashLayoutWindow`\nfor your subwindows since this class provides handlers for the required events, and\naccessors to specify the desired size of the window. The sash behaviour in the base class\ncan be used, optionally, to make the windows user-resizable.\n\n`m:wxLayoutAlgorithm` is typically used in IDE (integrated development environment)\napplications, where there are several resizable windows in addition to the MDI client\nwindow, or other primary editing window. Resizable windows might include toolbars, a\nproject window, and a window for displaying error and warning messages.\n\nWhen a window receives an OnCalculateLayout event, it should call SetRect in the given\nevent object, to be the old supplied rectangle minus whatever space the window takes up.\nIt should also set its own size accordingly. `wxSashLayoutWindow::OnCalculateLayout` (not\nimplemented in wx) generates an OnQueryLayoutInfo event which it sends to itself to\ndetermine the orientation, alignment and size of the window, which it gets from internal\nmember variables set by the application.\n\nThe algorithm works by starting off with a rectangle equal to the whole frame client\narea. It iterates through the frame children, generating\nwxLayoutAlgorithm::OnCalculateLayout events which subtract the window size and return the\nremaining rectangle for the next window to process. It is assumed (by `wxSashLayoutWindow::OnCalculateLayout`\n(not implemented in wx)) that a window stretches the full dimension of the frame client,\naccording to the orientation it specifies. For example, a horizontal window will stretch\nthe full width of the remaining portion of the frame client area. In the other\norientation, the window will be fixed to whatever size was specified by\nwxLayoutAlgorithm::OnQueryLayoutInfo. An alignment setting will make the window 'stick' to\nthe left, top, right or bottom of the remaining client area. This scheme implies that\norder of window creation is important. Say you wish to have an extra toolbar at the top of\nthe frame, a project window to the left of the MDI client window, and an output window\nabove the status bar. You should therefore create the windows in this order: toolbar,\noutput window, project window. This ensures that the toolbar and output window take up\nspace at the top and bottom, and then the remaining height in-between is used for the\nproject window.\n\n`m:wxLayoutAlgorithm` is quite independent of the way in which\nwxLayoutAlgorithm::OnCalculateLayout chooses to interpret a window's size and alignment.\nTherefore you could implement a different window class with a new\nwxLayoutAlgorithm::OnCalculateLayout event handler, that has a more sophisticated way of\nlaying out the windows. It might allow specification of whether stretching occurs in the\nspecified orientation, for example, rather than always assuming stretching. (This could,\nand probably should, be added to the existing implementation).\n\nNote: `m:wxLayoutAlgorithm` has nothing to do with `wxLayoutConstraints` (not implemented\nin wx). It is an alternative way of specifying layouts for which the normal constraint\nsystem is unsuitable.\n\nSee:\n* `m:wxSashEvent`\n\n* `m:wxSashLayoutWindow`\n\n* [Overview events](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_events.html#overview_events)\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxLayoutAlgorithm](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_layout_algorithm.html)","title":"wxLayoutAlgorithm","ref":"wxLayoutAlgorithm.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"Destroys the object","title":"wxLayoutAlgorithm.destroy/1","ref":"wxLayoutAlgorithm.html#destroy/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxLayoutAlgorithm.layoutFrame/2","ref":"wxLayoutAlgorithm.html#layoutFrame/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Lays out the children of a normal frame.\n\n`mainWindow` is set to occupy the remaining space.

A menu item with a special identifier `wxID_SEPARATOR`\nis a separator item and doesn't have an associated command but just makes a separator\nline appear in the menu.\n\nNote: Please note that `wxID_ABOUT` and `wxID_EXIT` are predefined by wxWidgets and have\na special meaning since entries using these IDs will be taken out of the normal menus\nunder macOS and will be inserted into the system menu (following the appropriate macOS\ninterface guideline).\n\nMenu items may be either `normal` items, `check` items or `radio` items. Normal items\ndon't have any special properties while the check items have a boolean flag associated to\nthem and they show a checkmark in the menu when the flag is set. wxWidgets automatically\ntoggles the flag value when the item is clicked and its value may be retrieved using\neither `isChecked/2` method of `m:wxMenu` or `m:wxMenuBar` itself or by using wxEvent::IsChecked when\nyou get the menu notification for the item in question.\n\nThe radio items are similar to the check items except that all the other items in the\nsame radio group are unchecked when a radio item is checked. The radio group is formed by\na contiguous range of radio items, i.e. it starts at the first item of this kind and ends\nwith the first item of a different kind (or the end of the menu). Notice that because the\nradio groups are defined in terms of the item positions inserting or removing the items in\nthe menu containing the radio items risks to not work correctly.\n\nAllocation strategy\n\nAll menus must be created on the `heap` because all menus attached to a menubar or to\nanother menu will be deleted by their parent when it is deleted. The only exception to\nthis rule are the popup menus (i.e. menus used with `wxWindow:popupMenu/4`) as wxWidgets does not destroy them\nto allow reusing the same menu more than once. But the exception applies only to the menus\nthemselves and not to any submenus of popup menus which are still destroyed by wxWidgets\nas usual and so must be heap-allocated.\n\nAs the frame menubar is deleted by the frame itself, it means that normally all menus\nused are deleted automatically.\n\nEvent handling\n\nEvent handlers for the commands generated by the menu items can be connected directly to\nthe menu object itself using `wxEvtHandler::Bind()` (not implemented in wx). If this menu\nis a submenu of another one, the events from its items can also be processed in the parent\nmenu and so on, recursively.\n\nIf the menu is part of a menu bar, then events can also be handled in `m:wxMenuBar` object.\n\nFinally, menu events can also be handled in the associated window, which is either the `m:wxFrame`\nassociated with the menu bar this menu belongs to or the window for which `wxWindow:popupMenu/4` was called for\nthe popup menus.\n\nSee overview_events_bind for how to bind event handlers to the various objects.\n\nSee:\n* `m:wxMenuBar`\n\n* `wxWindow:popupMenu/4`\n\n* [Overview events](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_events.html#overview_events)\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxEvtHandler`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxMenu](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_menu.html)","title":"wxMenu","ref":"wxMenu.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds a menu item object.\n\nThis is the most generic variant of `append/5` method because it may be used for both items\n(including separators) and submenus and because you can also specify various extra\nproperties of a menu item this way, such as bitmaps and fonts.\n\nRemark: See the remarks for the other `append/5` overloads.\n\nSee:\n* `appendSeparator/1`\n\n* `appendCheckItem/4`\n\n* `appendRadioItem/4`\n\n* `insert/6`\n\n* `setLabel/3`\n\n* `getHelpString/2`\n\n* `setHelpString/3`\n\n* `m:wxMenuItem`","title":"wxMenu.append/2","ref":"wxMenu.html#append/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxMenu.append/3","ref":"wxMenu.html#append/3"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds a menu item.\n\nExample: or even better for stock menu items (see `wxMenuItem:new/1`):\n\nRemark: This command can be used after the menu has been shown, as well as on initial\ncreation of a menu or menubar.\n\nSee:\n* `appendSeparator/1`\n\n* `appendCheckItem/4`\n\n* `appendRadioItem/4`\n\n* `insert/6`\n\n* `setLabel/3`\n\n* `getHelpString/2`\n\n* `setHelpString/3`\n\n* `m:wxMenuItem`","title":"wxMenu.append/4","ref":"wxMenu.html#append/4"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds a submenu.\n\nDeprecated:\n\nThis function is deprecated, use `AppendSubMenu()` (not implemented in wx) instead.\n\nSee:\n* `appendSeparator/1`\n\n* `appendCheckItem/4`\n\n* `appendRadioItem/4`\n\n* `insert/6`\n\n* `setLabel/3`\n\n* `getHelpString/2`\n\n* `setHelpString/3`\n\n* `m:wxMenuItem`","title":"wxMenu.append/5","ref":"wxMenu.html#append/5"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxMenu.appendCheckItem/3","ref":"wxMenu.html#appendCheckItem/3"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds a checkable item to the end of the menu.\n\nSee:\n* `append/5`\n\n* `insertCheckItem/5`","title":"wxMenu.appendCheckItem/4","ref":"wxMenu.html#appendCheckItem/4"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxMenu.appendRadioItem/3","ref":"wxMenu.html#appendRadioItem/3"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds a radio item to the end of the menu.\n\nAll consequent radio items form a group and when an item in the group is checked, all the\nothers are automatically unchecked.\n\nNote: Radio items are not supported under wxMotif.\n\nSee:\n* `append/5`\n\n* `insertRadioItem/5`","title":"wxMenu.appendRadioItem/4","ref":"wxMenu.html#appendRadioItem/4"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds a separator to the end of the menu.\n\nSee:\n* `append/5`\n\n* `insertSeparator/2`","title":"wxMenu.appendSeparator/1","ref":"wxMenu.html#appendSeparator/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Inserts a break in a menu, causing the next appended item to appear in a new column.\n\nThis function only actually inserts a break in wxMSW and does nothing under the other\nplatforms.","title":"wxMenu.break/1","ref":"wxMenu.html#break/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Checks or unchecks the menu item.\n\nSee: `isChecked/2`","title":"wxMenu.check/3","ref":"wxMenu.html#check/3"},{"type":"function","doc":"Deletes the menu item from the menu.\n\nIf the item is a submenu, it will be deleted.

And if the system supports\nmore buttons, the `wxMOUSE_BTN_AUX1` and `wxMOUSE_BTN_AUX2` events can also be generated.\nNote that not all mice have even a middle button so a portable application should avoid\nrelying on the events from it (but the right button click can be emulated using the left\nmouse button with the control key under Mac platforms with a single button mouse).\n\nFor the `wxEVT_ENTER_WINDOW` and `wxEVT_LEAVE_WINDOW` events purposes, the mouse is\nconsidered to be inside the window if it is in the window client area and not inside one\nof its children. In other words, the parent window receives `wxEVT_LEAVE_WINDOW` event not\nonly when the mouse leaves the window entirely but also when it enters one of its children.\n\nThe position associated with a mouse event is expressed in the window coordinates of the\nwindow which generated the event, you can use `wxWindow:clientToScreen/3` to convert it to screen coordinates and\npossibly call `wxWindow:screenToClient/2` next to convert it to window coordinates of another window.\n\nNote: Note the difference between methods like `leftDown/1` and the inherited `leftIsDown/1`: the former returns\ntrue when the event corresponds to the left mouse button click while the latter returns\ntrue if the left mouse button is currently being pressed. For example, when the user is\ndragging the mouse you can use `leftIsDown/1` to test whether the left mouse button is (still)\ndepressed. Also, by convention, if `leftDown/1` returns true, `leftIsDown/1` will also return true in wxWidgets\nwhatever the underlying GUI behaviour is (which is platform-dependent).

If your windows' drawing routines accept an arbitrary DC as an argument, you\ncan re-use those routines within your `m:wxPrintout` subclass to draw the printout image.\nYou may also add additional drawing elements within your `m:wxPrintout` subclass, like\nheaders, footers, and/or page numbers. However, the image on the printed page will often\ndiffer from the image drawn on the screen, as will the print preview image - not just in\nthe presence of headers and footers, but typically in scale. A high-resolution printer\npresents a much larger drawing surface (i.e., a higher-resolution DC); a zoomed-out\npreview image presents a much smaller drawing surface (lower-resolution DC). By using the\nroutines FitThisSizeToXXX() and/or MapScreenSizeToXXX() within your `m:wxPrintout`\nsubclass to set the user scale and origin of the associated DC, you can easily use a\nsingle drawing routine to draw on your application's windows, to create the print preview\nimage, and to create the printed paper image, and achieve a common appearance to the\npreview image and the printed page.\n\nSee:\n* [Overview printing](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_printing.html#overview_printing)\n\n* `m:wxPrintDialog`\n\n* `m:wxPageSetupDialog`\n\n* `m:wxPrinter`\n\n* `m:wxPrintPreview`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxPrintout](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_printout.html)","title":"wxPrintout","ref":"wxPrintout.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"Destroys the object","title":"wxPrintout.destroy/1","ref":"wxPrintout.html#destroy/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Set the user scale and device origin of the `m:wxDC` associated with this `m:wxPrintout`\nso that the given image size fits entirely within the page rectangle and the origin is at\nthe top left corner of the page rectangle.\n\nOn MSW and Mac, the page rectangle is the printable area of the page.

Derived from `m:wxPanel`, it shares `m:wxPanel`'s behaviour with regard\nto TAB traversal and focus handling. Use this if the scrolled window will have child controls.\n\n* ?wxScrolledCanvas, aka wxScrolled , derives from `m:wxWindow` and so doesn't\nhandle children specially. This is suitable e.g. for implementing scrollable controls such\nas tree or list controls.\n\nNote: See `wxScrolled::Create()` (not implemented in wx) if you want to use `wxScrolled`\n(not implemented in wx) with a custom class.\n\nStarting from version 2.4 of wxWidgets, there are several ways to use a\n?wxScrolledWindow (and now `wxScrolled` (not implemented in wx)). In particular, there are\nthree ways to set the size of the scrolling area:\n\nOne way is to set the scrollbars directly using a call to `setScrollbars/6`. This is the way it used to be\nin any previous version of wxWidgets and it will be kept for backwards compatibility.\n\nAn additional method of manual control, which requires a little less computation of your\nown, is to set the total size of the scrolling area by calling either `wxWindow:setVirtualSize/3`, or `wxWindow:fitInside/1`, and setting\nthe scrolling increments for it by calling `setScrollRate/3`. Scrolling in some orientation is enabled by\nsetting a non-zero increment for it.\n\nThe most automatic and newest way is to simply let sizers determine the scrolling area.\nThis is now the default when you set an interior sizer into a `wxScrolled` (not\nimplemented in wx) with `wxWindow:setSizer/3`. The scrolling area will be set to the size requested by the\nsizer and the scrollbars will be assigned for each orientation according to the need for\nthem and the scrolling increment set by `setScrollRate/3`. As above, scrolling is only enabled in\norientations with a non-zero increment. You can influence the minimum size of the scrolled\narea controlled by a sizer by calling wxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints(). (Calling `setScrollbars/6` has\nanalogous effects in wxWidgets 2.4 - in later versions it may not continue to override the sizer.)\n\nNote that if maximum size hints are still supported by wxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints(),\nuse them at your own dire risk. They may or may not have been removed for 2.4, but it\nreally only makes sense to set minimum size hints here. We should probably replace\nwxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints() with wxWindow::SetMinVirtualSize() or similar and remove\nit entirely in future.\n\nAs with all windows, an application can draw onto a `wxScrolled` (not implemented in wx)\nusing a device context.\n\nYou have the option of handling the OnPaint handler or overriding the `wxScrolled::OnDraw()`\n(not implemented in wx) function, which is passed a pre-scrolled device context (prepared\nby `doPrepareDC/2`).\n\nIf you don't wish to calculate your own scrolling, you must call `doPrepareDC/2` when not drawing from\nwithin `OnDraw()` (not implemented in wx), to set the device origin for the device context\naccording to the current scroll position.\n\nA `wxScrolled` (not implemented in wx) will normally scroll itself and therefore its\nchild windows as well. It might however be desired to scroll a different window than\nitself: e.g. when designing a spreadsheet, you will normally only have to scroll the\n(usually white) cell area, whereas the (usually grey) label area will scroll very\ndifferently. For this special purpose, you can call `setTargetWindow/2` which means that pressing the\nscrollbars will scroll a different window.\n\nNote that the underlying system knows nothing about scrolling coordinates, so that all\nsystem functions (mouse events, expose events, refresh calls etc) as well as the position\nof subwindows are relative to the \"physical\" origin of the scrolled window. If the user\ninsert a child window at position (10,10) and scrolls the window down 100 pixels (moving\nthe child window out of the visible area), the child window will report a position of (10,-90).","title":"wxScrolledWindow","ref":"wxScrolledWindow.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"This class supports the following styles:\n\n* wxHSCROLL: If this style is specified and ?wxVSCROLL isn't, the window will be scrollable\nonly in horizontal direction (by default, i.e. if neither this style nor ?wxVSCROLL is\nspecified, it scrolls in both directions).\n\n* wxVSCROLL: If this style is specified and ?wxHSCROLL isn't, the window will be scrollable\nonly in vertical direction (by default, i.e. if neither this style nor ?wxHSCROLL is\nspecified, it scrolls in both directions).\n\n* wxALWAYS_SHOW_SB: Since wxWidgets 2.9.5, specifying this style makes the window always\nshow its scrollbars, even if they are not used.

Currently there are `m:wxBoxSizer`, `m:wxStaticBoxSizer`, `m:wxGridSizer`, `m:wxFlexGridSizer`, `wxWrapSizer`\n(not implemented in wx) and `m:wxGridBagSizer`.\n\nThe layout algorithm used by sizers in wxWidgets is closely related to layout in other\nGUI toolkits, such as Java's AWT, the GTK toolkit or the Qt toolkit. It is based upon the\nidea of the individual subwindows reporting their minimal required size and their ability\nto get stretched if the size of the parent window has changed.\n\nThis will most often mean that the programmer does not set the original size of a dialog\nin the beginning, rather the dialog will be assigned a sizer and this sizer will be\nqueried about the recommended size. The sizer in turn will query its children, which can\nbe normal windows, empty space or other sizers, so that a hierarchy of sizers can be\nconstructed. Note that `m:wxSizer` does not derive from `m:wxWindow` and thus does not\ninterfere with tab ordering and requires very little resources compared to a real window\non screen.\n\nWhat makes sizers so well fitted for use in wxWidgets is the fact that every control\nreports its own minimal size and the algorithm can handle differences in font sizes or\ndifferent window (dialog item) sizes on different platforms without problems. If e.g. the\nstandard font as well as the overall design of Motif widgets requires more space than on\nWindows, the initial dialog size will automatically be bigger on Motif than on Windows.\n\nSizers may also be used to control the layout of custom drawn items on the window. The `add/4`, `insert/5`,\nand `prepend/4` functions return a pointer to the newly added `m:wxSizerItem`. Just add empty space\nof the desired size and attributes, and then use the `wxSizerItem:getRect/1` method to determine where the\ndrawing operations should take place.\n\nPlease notice that sizers, like child windows, are owned by the library and will be\ndeleted by it which implies that they must be allocated on the heap. However if you create\na sizer and do not add it to another sizer or window, the library wouldn't be able to\ndelete such an orphan sizer and in this, and only this, case it should be deleted explicitly.\n\nwxSizer flags\n\nThe \"flag\" argument accepted by `m:wxSizerItem` constructors and other functions, e.g. `add/4`,\nis an OR-combination of the following flags. Two main behaviours are defined using these\nflags. One is the border around a window: the border parameter determines the border width\nwhereas the flags given here determine which side(s) of the item that the border will be\nadded. The other flags determine how the sizer item behaves when the space allotted to the\nsizer changes, and is somewhat dependent on the specific kind of sizer used.\n\nSee: [Overview sizer](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_sizer.html#overview_sizer)\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxSizer](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_sizer.html)","title":"wxSizer","ref":"wxSizer.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxSizer.add/2","ref":"wxSizer.html#add/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Appends a child to the sizer.\n\n`m:wxSizer` itself is an abstract class, but the parameters are equivalent in the derived\nclasses that you will instantiate to use it so they are described here:","title":"wxSizer.add/3","ref":"wxSizer.html#add/3"},{"type":"function","doc":"Appends a spacer child to the sizer.","title":"wxSizer.add/4","ref":"wxSizer.html#add/4"},{"type":"function","doc":"This base function adds non-stretchable space to both the horizontal and vertical\norientation of the sizer.\n\nMore readable way of calling:\n\nSee: `addSpacer/2`","title":"wxSizer.addSpacer/2","ref":"wxSizer.html#addSpacer/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxSizer.addStretchSpacer/1","ref":"wxSizer.html#addStretchSpacer/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Adds stretchable space to the sizer.\n\nMore readable way of calling:","title":"wxSizer.addStretchSpacer/2","ref":"wxSizer.html#addStretchSpacer/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"This method is abstract and has to be overwritten by any derived class.\n\nHere, the sizer will do the actual calculation of its children's minimal sizes.","title":"wxSizer.calcMin/1","ref":"wxSizer.html#calcMin/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxSizer.clear/1","ref":"wxSizer.html#clear/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Detaches all children from the sizer.\n\nIf `delete_windows` is true then child windows will also be deleted.\n\nNotice that child sizers are always deleted, as a general consequence of the principle\nthat sizers own their sizer children, but don't own their window children (because they\nare already owned by their parent windows).","title":"wxSizer.clear/2","ref":"wxSizer.html#clear/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Detach a item at position `index` from the sizer without destroying it.\n\nThis method does not cause any layout or resizing to take place, call `layout/1` to update the\nlayout \"on screen\" after detaching a child from the sizer.

In short, the EVT_SCROLL_CHANGED event is\ntriggered when scrolling/ moving has finished independently of the way it had started.\nPlease see the page_samples_widgets (\"Slider\" page) to see the difference between\nEVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE and EVT_SCROLL_CHANGED in action.\n\nSee:\n* [Overview events](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_events.html#overview_events)\n\n* `m:wxScrollBar`\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxControl`\n\n* `m:wxWindow`\n\n* `m:wxEvtHandler`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxSlider](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_slider.html)","title":"Styles - wxSlider","ref":"wxSlider.html#module-styles"},{"type":"module","doc":"Event types emitted from this class:\n\n* [`scroll_top`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_bottom`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_lineup`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_linedown`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_pageup`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_pagedown`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_thumbtrack`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_thumbrelease`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_changed`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_top`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_bottom`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_lineup`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_linedown`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_pageup`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_pagedown`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_thumbtrack`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_thumbrelease`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`scroll_changed`](`m:wxScrollEvent`)\n\n* [`command_slider_updated`](`m:wxCommandEvent`)","title":"Events - wxSlider","ref":"wxSlider.html#module-events"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxSlider.create/6","ref":"wxSlider.html#create/6"},{"type":"function","doc":"Used for two-step slider construction.\n\nSee `new/6` for further details.","title":"wxSlider.create/7","ref":"wxSlider.html#create/7"},{"type":"function","doc":"Destroys the object","title":"wxSlider.destroy/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#destroy/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns the line size.\n\nSee: `setLineSize/2`","title":"wxSlider.getLineSize/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#getLineSize/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Gets the maximum slider value.\n\nSee:\n* `getMin/1`\n\n* `setRange/3`","title":"wxSlider.getMax/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#getMax/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Gets the minimum slider value.\n\nSee:\n* `getMin/1`\n\n* `setRange/3`","title":"wxSlider.getMin/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#getMin/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns the page size.\n\nSee: `setPageSize/2`","title":"wxSlider.getPageSize/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#getPageSize/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns the thumb length.\n\nOnly for:wxmsw\n\nSee: `setThumbLength/2`","title":"wxSlider.getThumbLength/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#getThumbLength/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Gets the current slider value.\n\nSee:\n* `getMin/1`\n\n* `getMax/1`\n\n* `setValue/2`","title":"wxSlider.getValue/1","ref":"wxSlider.html#getValue/1"},{"type":"function","doc":"Default constructor.","title":"wxSlider.new/0","ref":"wxSlider.html#new/0"},{"type":"function","doc":"","title":"wxSlider.new/5","ref":"wxSlider.html#new/5"},{"type":"function","doc":"Constructor, creating and showing a slider.\n\nSee: `create/7`","title":"wxSlider.new/6","ref":"wxSlider.html#new/6"},{"type":"function","doc":"Sets the line size for the slider.\n\nSee: `getLineSize/1`","title":"wxSlider.setLineSize/2","ref":"wxSlider.html#setLineSize/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Sets the page size for the slider.\n\nSee: `getPageSize/1`","title":"wxSlider.setPageSize/2","ref":"wxSlider.html#setPageSize/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Sets the minimum and maximum slider values.\n\nSee:\n* `getMin/1`\n\n* `getMax/1`","title":"wxSlider.setRange/3","ref":"wxSlider.html#setRange/3"},{"type":"function","doc":"Sets the slider thumb length.\n\nOnly for:wxmsw\n\nSee: `getThumbLength/1`","title":"wxSlider.setThumbLength/2","ref":"wxSlider.html#setThumbLength/2"},{"type":"function","doc":"Sets the slider position.","title":"wxSlider.setValue/2","ref":"wxSlider.html#setValue/2"},{"type":"type","doc":"","title":"wxSlider.wxSlider/0","ref":"wxSlider.html#t:wxSlider/0"},{"type":"module","doc":"A `m:wxSpinButton` has two small up and down (or left and right) arrow buttons.\n\nIt is often used next to a text control for increment and decrementing a value.

Notice that any characters not allowed in the environment variables names, such as\nperiods and dashes, should be replaced with underscores. E.g. to define a system option\n\"foo-bar\" you need to define the environment variable \"wx_foo_bar\".\n\nThe program may use system options for its own needs but they are mostly used to control\nthe behaviour of wxWidgets library itself.\n\nThese options are currently recognised by wxWidgets:\n\nAll platforms\n\n* exit-on-assert: If set to non-zero value, abort the program if an assertion fails. The\ndefault behaviour in case of assertion failure depends on the build mode and can be\nchanged by overriding `wxApp::OnAssertFailure()` (not implemented in wx) but setting this\noption allows changing it without modifying the program code and also applies to asserts\nwhich may happen before the `wxApp` (not implemented in wx) object creation or after its\ndestruction.\n\nWindows\n\n* no-maskblt: 1 to never use WIN32's MaskBlt function, 0 to allow it to be used where\npossible. Default: 0. In some circumstances the MaskBlt function can be slower than using\nthe fallback code, especially if using DC caching. By default, MaskBlt will be used where\nit is implemented by the operating system and driver.\n\n* msw.remap: If 1 (the default), `m:wxToolBar` bitmap colours will be remapped to the\ncurrent theme's values. Set this to 0 to disable this functionality, for example if you're\nusing more than 16 colours in your tool bitmaps.\n\n* msw.window.no-clip-children: If 1, windows will not automatically get the WS_CLIPCHILDREN\nstyle. This restores the way windows are refreshed back to the method used in versions of\nwxWidgets earlier than 2.5.4, and for some complex window hierarchies it can reduce\napparent refresh delays. You may still specify wxCLIP_CHILDREN for individual windows.\n\n* msw.notebook.themed-background: If set to 0, globally disables themed backgrounds on\nnotebook pages. Note that this won't disable the theme on the actual notebook background\n(noticeable only if there are no pages).\n\n* msw.staticbox.optimized-paint: If set to 0, switches off optimized `m:wxStaticBox`\npainting. Setting this to 0 causes more flicker, but allows applications to paint graphics\non the parent of a static box (the optimized refresh causes any such drawing to\ndisappear).\n\n* msw.font.no-proof-quality: If set to 1, use default fonts quality instead of proof\nquality when creating fonts. With proof quality the fonts have slightly better appearance\nbut not all fonts are available in this quality, e.g. the Terminal font in small sizes is\nnot and this option may be used if wider fonts selection is more important than higher\nquality.\n\nGTK+\n\n* gtk.tlw.can-set-transparent: `wxTopLevelWindow::CanSetTransparent()` (not implemented in\nwx) method normally tries to detect automatically whether transparency for top level\nwindows is currently supported, however this may sometimes fail and this option allows\noverriding the automatic detection. Setting it to 1 makes the transparency be always\navailable (setting it can still fail, of course) and setting it to 0 makes it always\nunavailable.\n\n* gtk.desktop: This option can be set to override the default desktop environment\ndetermination. Supported values are GNOME and KDE.\n\n* gtk.window.force-background-colour: If 1, the backgrounds of windows with the\nwxBG_STYLE_COLOUR background style are cleared forcibly instead of relying on the\nunderlying GTK+ window colour. This works around a display problem when running\napplications under KDE with the gtk-qt theme installed (0.6 and below).\n\nMac\n\n* mac.window-plain-transition: If 1, uses a plainer transition when showing a window. You\ncan also use the symbol wxMAC_WINDOW_PLAIN_TRANSITION.\n\n* window-default-variant: The default variant used by windows (cast to integer from the\nwxWindowVariant enum). Also known as wxWINDOW_DEFAULT_VARIANT.\n\n* mac.listctrl.always_use_generic: Tells `m:wxListCtrl` to use the generic control even\nwhen it is capable of using the native control instead. Also known as\nwxMAC_ALWAYS_USE_GENERIC_LISTCTRL.\n\n* mac.textcontrol-use-spell-checker: If 1 activates the spell checking in `m:wxTextCtrl`.\n\n* osx.openfiledialog.always-show-types: Per default a `m:wxFileDialog` with wxFD_OPEN does\nnot show a types-popup on macOS but allows the selection of files from any of the\nsupported types. Setting this to 1 shows a `m:wxChoice` for selection (if there is more\nthan one supported filetype).\n\nMotif\n\n* motif.largebuttons: If 1, uses a bigger default size for wxButtons.\n\nThe compile-time option to include or exclude this functionality is wxUSE_SYSTEM_OPTIONS.\n\nSee: `m:wxSystemSettings`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxSystemOptions](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_system_options.html)","title":"wxSystemOptions","ref":"wxSystemOptions.html"},{"type":"function","doc":"Gets an option.\n\nThe function is case-insensitive to `name`.

Otherwise, i.e. either if this style not specified at all, or it\nis used, but there is no event handler for this event or the event handler called `wxEvent:skip/2` to\navoid overriding the default handling, pressing Enter key is either processed internally\nby the control or used to activate the default button of the dialog, if any.\n\n* wxTE_PROCESS_TAB: Normally, TAB key is used for keyboard navigation and pressing it in a\ncontrol switches focus to the next one. With this style, this won't happen and if the TAB\nis not otherwise processed (e.g. by `wxEVT_CHAR` event handler), a literal TAB character\nis inserted into the control. Notice that this style has no effect for single-line text\ncontrols when using wxGTK.\n\n* wxTE_MULTILINE: The text control allows multiple lines. If this style is not specified,\nline break characters should not be used in the controls value.\n\n* wxTE_PASSWORD: The text will be echoed as asterisks.\n\n* wxTE_READONLY: The text will not be user-editable.\n\n* wxTE_RICH: Use rich text control under MSW, this allows having more than 64KB of text in\nthe control. This style is ignored under other platforms.\n\n* wxTE_RICH2: Use rich text control version 2.0 or higher under MSW, this style is ignored\nunder other platforms\n\n* wxTE_AUTO_URL: Highlight the URLs and generate the wxTextUrlEvents when mouse events\noccur over them.\n\n* wxTE_NOHIDESEL: By default, the Windows text control doesn't show the selection when it\ndoesn't have focus - use this style to force it to always show it. It doesn't do anything\nunder other platforms.\n\n* wxHSCROLL: A horizontal scrollbar will be created and used, so that text won't be\nwrapped. No effect under wxGTK1.\n\n* wxTE_NO_VSCROLL: For multiline controls only: vertical scrollbar will never be created.\nThis limits the amount of text which can be entered into the control to what can be\ndisplayed in it under wxMSW but not under wxGTK or wxOSX. Currently not implemented for\nthe other platforms.\n\n* wxTE_LEFT: The text in the control will be left-justified (default).\n\n* wxTE_CENTRE: The text in the control will be centered (wxMSW, wxGTK, wxOSX).\n\n* wxTE_RIGHT: The text in the control will be right-justified (wxMSW, wxGTK, wxOSX).\n\n* wxTE_DONTWRAP: Same as wxHSCROLL style: don't wrap at all, show horizontal scrollbar\ninstead.\n\n* wxTE_CHARWRAP: For multiline controls only: wrap the lines too long to be shown entirely\nat any position (wxUniv, wxGTK, wxOSX).\n\n* wxTE_WORDWRAP: For multiline controls only: wrap the lines too long to be shown entirely\nat word boundaries (wxUniv, wxMSW, wxGTK, wxOSX).\n\n* wxTE_BESTWRAP: For multiline controls only: wrap the lines at word boundaries or at any\nother character if there are words longer than the window width (this is the default).\n\n* wxTE_CAPITALIZE: On PocketPC and Smartphone, causes the first letter to be capitalized.\nNote that alignment styles (wxTE_LEFT, wxTE_CENTRE and wxTE_RIGHT) can be changed\ndynamically after control creation on wxMSW, wxGTK and wxOSX. wxTE_READONLY, wxTE_PASSWORD\nand wrapping styles can be dynamically changed under wxGTK but not wxMSW. The other styles\ncan be only set during control creation.\n\nwxTextCtrl Text Format\n\nThe multiline text controls always store the text as a sequence of lines separated by `'\\n'`\ncharacters, i.e. in the Unix text format even on non-Unix platforms. This allows the user\ncode to ignore the differences between the platforms but at a price: the indices in the\ncontrol such as those returned by `getInsertionPoint/1` or `getSelection/1` can `not` be used as indices into the string\nreturned by `getValue/1` as they're going to be slightly off for platforms using `\"\\\\r\\\\n\"` as\nseparator (as Windows does).\n\nInstead, if you need to obtain a substring between the 2 indices obtained from the\ncontrol with the help of the functions mentioned above, you should use `getRange/3`. And the indices\nthemselves can only be passed to other methods, for example `setInsertionPoint/2` or `setSelection/3`.\n\nTo summarize: never use the indices returned by (multiline) `m:wxTextCtrl` as indices\ninto the string it contains, but only as arguments to be passed back to the other `m:wxTextCtrl`\nmethods. This problem doesn't arise for single-line platforms however where the indices\nin the control do correspond to the positions in the value string.\n\nwxTextCtrl Positions and Coordinates\n\nIt is possible to use either linear positions, i.e. roughly (but `not` always exactly, as\nexplained in the previous section) the index of the character in the text contained in the\ncontrol or X-Y coordinates, i.e. column and line of the character when working with this\nclass and it provides the functions `positionToXY/2` and `xYToPosition/3` to convert between the two.\n\nAdditionally, a position in the control can be converted to its coordinates in pixels\nusing `PositionToCoords()` (not implemented in wx) which can be useful to e.g. show a\npopup menu near the given character. And, in the other direction, `HitTest()` (not\nimplemented in wx) can be used to find the character under, or near, the given pixel coordinates.\n\nTo be more precise, positions actually refer to the gaps between characters and not the\ncharacters themselves. Thus, position 0 is the one before the very first character in the\ncontrol and so is a valid position even when the control is empty. And if the control\ncontains a single character, it has two valid positions: 0 before this character and 1 -\nafter it. This, when the documentation of various functions mentions \"invalid position\",\nit doesn't consider the position just after the last character of the line to be invalid,\nonly the positions beyond that one (e.g. 2 and greater in the single character example)\nare actually invalid.\n\nwxTextCtrl Styles.\n\nMulti-line text controls support styling, i.e. provide a possibility to set colours and\nfont for individual characters in it (note that under Windows `wxTE_RICH` style is\nrequired for style support). To use the styles you can either call `setDefaultStyle/2` before inserting the\ntext or call `setStyle/4` later to change the style of the text already in the control (the first\nsolution is much more efficient).\n\nIn either case, if the style doesn't specify some of the attributes (for example you only\nwant to set the text colour but without changing the font nor the text background), the\nvalues of the default style will be used for them. If there is no default style, the\nattributes of the text control itself are used.\n\nSo the following code correctly describes what it does: the second call to `setDefaultStyle/2` doesn't\nchange the text foreground colour (which stays red) while the last one doesn't change the\nbackground colour (which stays grey):\n\nwxTextCtrl and C++ Streams\n\nThis class multiply-inherits from `std::streambuf` (except for some really old compilers\nusing non-standard iostream library), allowing code such as the following:\n\nNote that even if your build of wxWidgets doesn't support this (the symbol `wxHAS_TEXT_WINDOW_STREAM`\nhas value of 0 then) you can still use `m:wxTextCtrl` itself in a stream-like manner:\n\nHowever the possibility to create a `std::ostream` associated with `m:wxTextCtrl` may be\nuseful if you need to redirect the output of a function taking a `std::ostream` as\nparameter to a text control.\n\nAnother commonly requested need is to redirect `std::cout` to the text control. This may\nbe done in the following way:\n\nBut wxWidgets provides a convenient class to make it even simpler so instead you may just do\n\nSee `wxStreamToTextRedirector` (not implemented in wx) for more details.\n\nEvent Handling.\n\nThe following commands are processed by default event handlers in `m:wxTextCtrl`: `wxID_CUT`, `wxID_COPY`, `wxID_PASTE`, `wxID_UNDO`, `wxID_REDO`.\nThe associated UI update events are also processed automatically, when the control has the focus.\n\nSee: `create/4`\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxControl`\n\n* `m:wxWindow`\n\n* `m:wxEvtHandler`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxTextCtrl](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_text_ctrl.html)","title":"Styles - wxTextCtrl","ref":"wxTextCtrl.html#module-styles"},{"type":"module","doc":"Event types emitted from this class:\n\n* [`command_text_updated`](`m:wxCommandEvent`)\n\n* [`command_text_enter`](`m:wxCommandEvent`)\n\n* [`text_maxlen`](`m:wxCommandEvent`)","title":"Events - wxTextCtrl","ref":"wxTextCtrl.html#module-events"},{"type":"function","doc":"Appends the text to the end of the text control.\n\nRemark: After the text is appended, the insertion point will be at the end of the text\ncontrol.

The code for doing this has to be mixed up with the code that is invoked when an\naction is invoked for a menu item or button.\n\nWith update UI events, you define an event handler to look at the state of the\napplication and change UI elements accordingly. wxWidgets will call your member functions\nin idle time, so you don't have to worry where to call this code.\n\nIn addition to being a clearer and more declarative method, it also means you don't have\nto worry whether you're updating a toolbar or menubar identifier. The same handler can\nupdate a menu item and toolbar button, if the identifier is the same. Instead of directly\nmanipulating the menu or button, you call functions in the event object, such as `check/2`.\nwxWidgets will determine whether such a call has been made, and which UI element to update.\n\nThese events will work for popup menus as well as menubars. Just before a menu is popped\nup, `wxMenu::UpdateUI` (not implemented in wx) is called to process any UI events for the\nwindow that owns the menu.\n\nIf you find that the overhead of UI update processing is affecting your application, you\ncan do one or both of the following:\n\n* Call `setMode/1` with a value of wxUPDATE_UI_PROCESS_SPECIFIED, and set the extra style\nwxWS_EX_PROCESS_UI_UPDATES for every window that should receive update events. No other\nwindows will receive update events.\n\n* Call `setUpdateInterval/1` with a millisecond value to set the delay between updates. You may need to call `wxWindow:updateWindowUI/2` at\ncritical points, for example when a dialog is about to be shown, in case the user sees a\nslight delay before windows are updated.\n\nNote that although events are sent in idle time, defining a `m:wxIdleEvent` handler for\na window does not affect this because the events are sent from `wxWindow::OnInternalIdle`\n(not implemented in wx) which is always called in idle time.\n\nwxWidgets tries to optimize update events on some platforms. On Windows and GTK+, events\nfor menubar items are only sent when the menu is about to be shown, and not in idle time.\n\nSee: [Overview events](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_events.html#overview_events)\n\nThis class is derived, and can use functions, from:\n\n* `m:wxCommandEvent`\n\n* `m:wxEvent`\n\nwxWidgets docs: [wxUpdateUIEvent](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_update_u_i_event.html)","title":"wxUpdateUIEvent","ref":"wxUpdateUIEvent.html"},{"type":"module","doc":"Use `wxEvtHandler:connect/3` with `wxUpdateUIEventType` to subscribe to events of this type.","title":"Events - wxUpdateUIEvent","ref":"wxUpdateUIEvent.html#module-events"},{"type":"function","doc":"Returns true if it is appropriate to update (send UI update events to) this window.\n\nThis function looks at the mode used (see `setMode/1`), the wxWS_EX_PROCESS_UI_UPDATES flag in `window`,\nthe time update events were last sent in idle time, and the update interval, to determine\nwhether events should be sent to this window now.

It differs from `m:wxHtmlWindow` in that each backend is\nactually a full rendering engine, Trident on MSW and Webkit on macOS and GTK. This allows\nthe correct viewing of complex pages with javascript and css.\n\nBackend Descriptions\n\nPar:\n\nThe IE backend uses Microsoft's Trident rendering engine, specifically the version used\nby the locally installed copy of Internet Explorer. As such it is only available for the\nMSW port. By default recent versions of the [WebBrowser](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa752085%28v=VS.85%29.aspx)\ncontrol, which this backend uses, emulate Internet Explorer 7. This can be changed with a\nregistry setting by wxWebView::MSWSetEmulationLevel() see [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#browser_emulation)\narticle for more information. This backend has full support for custom schemes and\nvirtual file systems.\n\nPar:\n\nThe Edge (Chromium) backend uses Microsoft's [Edge WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2).\nIt is available for Windows 7 and newer. The following features are currently unsupported\nwith this backend: virtual filesystems, custom urls, find.\n\nThis backend is not enabled by default, to build it follow these steps:\n\n* Visual Studio 2015, or newer, is required\n\n* Download the [WebView2 SDK](https://aka.ms/webviewnuget) nuget package (Version 0.9.488\nor newer)\n\n* Extract the package (it's a zip archive) to `wxWidgets/3rdparty/webview2` (you should\nhave `3rdparty/webview2/build/native/include/WebView2.h` file after unpacking it)\n\n* Enable `wxUSE_WEBVIEW_EDGE` in CMake or `setup.h`\n\n* Build wxWidgets webview library\n\n* Copy `WebView2Loader.dll` from the subdirectory corresponding to the architecture used\n(x86 or x64) of `wxWidgets/3rdparty/webview2/build/` to your applications executable\n\n* At runtime you can use `isBackendAvailable/1` to check if the backend can be used (it will be available if `WebView2Loader.dll`\ncan be loaded and Edge (Chromium) is installed)\n\n* Make sure to add a note about using the WebView2 SDK to your application documentation,\nas required by its licence\n\nPar:\n\nUnder GTK the WebKit backend uses [WebKitGTK+](http://webkitgtk.org/). The current\nminimum version required is 1.3.1 which ships by default with Ubuntu Natty and Debian\nWheezy and has the package name libwebkitgtk-dev. Custom schemes and virtual files systems\nare supported under this backend, however embedded resources such as images and\nstylesheets are currently loaded using the data:// scheme.\n\nPar:\n\nUnder GTK3 the WebKit2 version of [WebKitGTK+](http://webkitgtk.org/) is used. In Ubuntu\nthe required package name is libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev and under Fedora it is\nwebkitgtk4-devel. All wxWEBVIEW_WEBKIT features are supported except for clearing and\nenabling / disabling the history.\n\nPar:\n\nThe macOS WebKit backend uses Apple's [WebView](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/WebKit/Classes/WebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001903)\nclass. This backend has full support for custom schemes and virtual file systems.\n\nAsynchronous Notifications\n\nMany of the methods in `m:wxWebView` are asynchronous, i.e. they return immediately and\nperform their work in the background. This includes functions such as `loadURL/2` and `reload/2`. To receive\nnotification of the progress and completion of these functions you need to handle the\nevents that are provided. Specifically `wxEVT_WEBVIEW_LOADED` notifies when the page or a\nsub-frame has finished loading and `wxEVT_WEBVIEW_ERROR` notifies that an error has occurred.\n\nVirtual File Systems and Custom Schemes\n\n`m:wxWebView` supports the registering of custom scheme handlers, for example `file` or `http`.\nTo do this create a new class which inherits from `wxWebViewHandler` (not implemented in\nwx), where wxWebHandler::GetFile() returns a pointer to a `wxFSFile` (not implemented in\nwx) which represents the given url.

Windows only.\n\n* wxBORDER_THEME: Displays a native border suitable for a control, on the current platform.\nOn Windows, this will be a themed border; on most other platforms a sunken border will be\nused. For more information for themed borders on Windows, please see Themed borders on\nWindows.\n\n* wxBORDER_NONE: Displays no border, overriding the default border style for the window.\nwxNO_BORDER is the old name for this style.\n\n* wxBORDER_DOUBLE: This style is obsolete and should not be used.\n\n* wxTRANSPARENT_WINDOW: The window is transparent, that is, it will not receive paint\nevents. Windows only.\n\n* wxTAB_TRAVERSAL: This style is used by wxWidgets for the windows supporting TAB\nnavigation among their children, such as `m:wxDialog` and `m:wxPanel`. It should almost\nnever be used in the application code.\n\n* wxWANTS_CHARS: Use this to indicate that the window wants to get all char/key events for\nall keys - even for keys like TAB or ENTER which are usually used for dialog navigation\nand which wouldn't be generated without this style. If you need to use this style in order\nto get the arrows or etc., but would still like to have normal keyboard navigation take\nplace, you should call Navigate in response to the key events for Tab and Shift-Tab.\n\n* wxNO_FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE: On Windows, this style used to disable repainting the window\ncompletely when its size is changed. Since this behaviour is now the default, the style is\nnow obsolete and no longer has an effect.\n\n* wxVSCROLL: Use this style to enable a vertical scrollbar. Notice that this style cannot\nbe used with native controls which don't support scrollbars nor with top-level windows in\nmost ports.\n\n* wxHSCROLL: Use this style to enable a horizontal scrollbar. The same limitations as for\nwxVSCROLL apply to this style.\n\n* wxALWAYS_SHOW_SB: If a window has scrollbars, disable them instead of hiding them when\nthey are not needed (i.e. when the size of the window is big enough to not require the\nscrollbars to navigate it). This style is currently implemented for wxMSW, wxGTK and\nwxUniversal and does nothing on the other platforms.\n\n* wxCLIP_CHILDREN: Use this style to eliminate flicker caused by the background being\nrepainted, then children being painted over them. Windows only.\n\n* wxFULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE: Use this style to force a complete redraw of the window\nwhenever it is resized instead of redrawing just the part of the window affected by\nresizing. Note that this was the behaviour by default before 2.5.1 release and that if you\nexperience redraw problems with code which previously used to work you may want to try\nthis.

Dialogs have this flag on by default for the reasons\nexplained in the overview_events.\n\n* wxWS_EX_TRANSIENT: Don't use this window as an implicit parent for the other windows:\nthis must be used with transient windows as otherwise there is the risk of creating a\ndialog/frame with this window as a parent, which would lead to a crash if the parent were\ndestroyed before the child.\n\n* wxWS_EX_CONTEXTHELP: Under Windows, puts a query button on the caption.

They\ncan also provide some help on how to use the API.\n\nThis is currently a very brief introduction to _wx_. The application is still\nunder development, which means the interface may change, and the test suite\ncurrently have a poor coverage ratio.","title":"wx the erlang binding of wxWidgets","ref":"chapter.html"},{"type":"extras","doc":"- [Introduction](chapter.md#introduction)\n- [Multiple processes and memory handling](chapter.md#Multiple_processes_and_memory_handling)\n- [Event Handling](chapter.md#Event_Handling)\n- [Acknowledgments](chapter.md#acknowledgments)","title":"Contents - wx the erlang binding of wxWidgets","ref":"chapter.html#contents"},{"type":"extras","doc":"The original _wxWidgets_ is an object-oriented (C++) API and that is reflected\nin the erlang mapping. In most cases each class in wxWidgets is represented as a\nmodule in erlang. This gives the _wx_ application a huge interface, spread over\nseveral modules, and it all starts with the _wx_ module. The _wx_ module\ncontains functions to create and destroy the GUI, i.e. `wx:new/0`,\n`wx:destroy/0`, and some other useful functions.\n\nObjects or object references in _wx_ should be seen as erlang processes rather\nthan erlang terms. When you operate on them they can change state, e.g. they are\nnot functional objects as erlang terms are. Each object has a type or rather a\nclass, which is manipulated with the corresponding module or by sub-classes of\nthat object. Type checking is done so that a module only operates on it's\nobjects or inherited classes.\n\nAn object is created with _new_ and destroyed with _destroy_. Most functions in\nthe classes are named the same as their C++ counterpart, except that for\nconvenience, in erlang they start with a lowercase letter and the first argument\nis the object reference. Optional arguments are last and expressed as tagged\ntuples in any order.\n\nFor example the _wxWindow_ C++ class is implemented in the _wxWindow_ erlang\nmodule and the member _wxWindow::CenterOnParent_ is thus\n_wxWindow:centerOnParent_. The following C++ code:\n\n```erlang\n  wxWindow MyWin = new wxWindow();\n  MyWin.CenterOnParent(wxVERTICAL);\n  ...\n  delete MyWin;\n```\n\nwould in erlang look like:\n\n```erlang\n  MyWin = wxWindow:new(),\n  wxWindow:centerOnParent(MyWin, [{dir,?wxVERTICAL}]),\n  ...\n  wxWindow:destroy(MyWin),\n```\n\nWhen you are reading wxWidgets documentation or the examples, you will notice\nthat some of the most basic classes are missing in _wx_, they are directly\nmapped to corresponding erlang terms:\n\n- **_wxPoint_ is represented by \\{Xcoord,Ycoord\\}**\n\n- **_wxSize_ is represented by \\{Width,Height\\}**\n\n- **_wxRect_ is represented by \\{Xcoord,Ycoord,Width,Height\\}**\n\n- **_wxColour_ is represented by \\{Red,Green,Blue\\[,Alpha]\\}**\n\n- **_wxString_ is represented by\n  [unicode:charlist()](`t:unicode:charlist/0`)**\n\n- **_wxGBPosition_ is represented by \\{Row,Column\\}**\n\n- **_wxGBSpan_ is represented by \\{RowSpan,ColumnSPan\\}**\n\n- **_wxGridCellCoords_ is represented by \\{Row,Column\\}**\n\nIn the places where the erlang API differs from the original one it should be\nobvious from the erlang documentation which representation has been used. E.g.\nthe C++ arrays and/or lists are sometimes represented as erlang lists and\nsometimes as tuples.\n\nColours are represented with \\{Red,Green,Blue\\[,Alpha]\\}, the Alpha value is\noptional when used as an argument to functions, but it will always be returned\nfrom _wx_ functions.\n\nDefines, enumerations and global variables exists in `wx.hrl` as defines. Most\nof these defines are constants but not all. Some are platform dependent and\ntherefore the global variables must be instantiated during runtime. These will\nbe acquired from the driver with a call, so not all defines can be used in\nmatching statements. Class local enumerations will be prefixed with the class\nname and a underscore as in `ClassName_Enum`.\n\nAdditionally some global functions, i.e. non-class functions, exist in the\n`wx_misc` module.\n\n_Wx_ is implemented as a (threaded) driver and a rather direct interface\nto the C++ API, with the drawback that if the erlang programmer does an error,\nit might crash the emulator.\n\nSince the driver is threaded it requires a _smp_ enabled emulator, that provides\na thread safe interface to the driver.\n\n[](){: #Multiple_processes_and_memory_handling }","title":"Introduction - wx the erlang binding of wxWidgets","ref":"chapter.html#introduction"},{"type":"extras","doc":"The intention is that each erlang application calls wx:new() once to setup it's\nGUI which creates an environment and a memory mapping. To be able to use _wx_\nfrom several processes in your application, you must share the environment. You\ncan get the active environment with `wx:get_env/0` and set it in the new\nprocesses with `wx:set_env/1`. Two processes or applications which have both\ncalled wx:new() will not be able use each others objects.\n\n```erlang\n  wx:new(),\n  MyWin = wxFrame:new(wx:null(), 42, \"Example\", []),\n  Env = wx:get_env(),\n  spawn(fun() ->\n           wx:set_env(Env),\n           %% Here you can do wx calls from your helper process.\n           ...\n        end),\n  ...\n```\n\nWhen `wx:destroy/0` is invoked or when all processes in the application have\ndied, the memory is deleted and all windows created by that application are\nclosed.\n\nThe _wx_ application never cleans or garbage collects memory as long as the user\napplication is alive. Most of the objects are deleted when a window is closed,\nor at least all the objects which have a parent argument that is non null. By\nusing `wxCLASS:destroy/1` when possible you can avoid an increasing memory\nusage. This is especially important when _wxWidgets_ assumes or recommends that\nyou (or rather the C++ programmer) have allocated the object on the stack since\nthat will never be done in the erlang binding. For example `wxDC` class or its\nsub-classes or `wxSizerFlags`.\n\nCurrently the dialogs show modal function freezes wxWidgets until the dialog is\nclosed. That is intended but in erlang where you can have several GUI\napplications running at the same time it causes trouble. This will hopefully be\nfixed in future _wxWidgets_ releases.\n\n[](){: #Event_Handling }","title":"Multiple processes and memory handling - wx the erlang binding of wxWidgets","ref":"chapter.html#multiple-processes-and-memory-handling"},{"type":"extras","doc":"Event handling in _wx_ differs most from the original API. You must specify\nevery event you want to handle in _wxWidgets_, that is the same in the erlang\nbinding but you can choose to receive the events as messages or handle them with\ncallback _funs_.\n\nOtherwise the event subscription is handled as _wxWidgets_ dynamic event-handler\nconnection. You subscribe to events of a certain type from objects with an _ID_\nor within a range of *ID*s. The callback _fun_ is optional, if not supplied the\nevent will be sent to the process that called _connect/2_. Thus, a handler is a\ncallback _fun_ or a process which will receive an event message.\n\nEvents are handled in order from bottom to top, in the widgets hierarchy, by the\nlast subscribed handler first. Depending on if `wxEvent:skip()` is called the\nevent will be handled by the other handler(s) afterwards. Most of the events\nhave default event handler(s) installed.\n\nMessage events looks like\n[\\#wx\\{id=integer(), obj=wx:wxObject(), userData=term(), event=Rec](`t:wxEvtHandler:wx/0`)\n\\}. The _id_ is the identifier of the object that received the event. The _obj_\nfield contains the object that you used _connect_ on. The _userData_ field\ncontains a user supplied term, this is an option to _connect_. And the _event_\nfield contains a record with event type dependent information. The first element\nin the event record is always the type you subscribed to. For example if you\nsubscribed to _key_up_ events you will receive the `#wx{event=Event}` where\n_Event_ will be a _wxKey_ event record where `Event#wxKey.type = key_up`.\n\nIn _wxWidgets_ the developer has to call `wxEvent:skip()` if he wants the event\nto be processed by other handlers. You can do the same in _wx_ if you use\ncallbacks. If you want the event as messages you just don't supply a callback\nand you can set the _skip_ option in _connect_ call to true or false, the\ndefault it is false. True means that you get the message but let the subsequent\nhandlers also handle the event. If you want to change this behavior dynamically\nyou must use callbacks and call `wxEvent:skip()`.\n\nCallback event handling is done by using the optional callback _fun/2_ when\nattaching the handler. The _fun(#wx\\{\\},wxObject()_ must take two arguments\nwhere the first is the same as with message events described above and the\nsecond is an object reference to the actual event object. With the event object\nyou can call `wxEvent:skip()` and access all the data. When using callbacks you\nmust call `wxEvent:skip()` by yourself if you want any of the events to be\nforwarded to the following handlers. The actual event objects are deleted after\nthe _fun_ returns.\n\nThe callbacks are always invoked by another process and have exclusive usage of\nthe GUI when invoked. This means that a callback _fun_ cannot use the process\ndictionary and should not make calls to other processes. Calls to another\nprocess inside a callback _fun_ may cause a deadlock if the other process is\nwaiting on completion of his call to the GUI.","title":"Event Handling - wx the erlang binding of wxWidgets","ref":"chapter.html#event-handling"},{"type":"extras","doc":"Mats-Ola Persson wrote the initial _wxWidgets_ binding as part of his master\nthesis.
